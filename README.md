How do you know what 5x5 is?  You memorized it way back in grade school. So do the same for hexidecimal conversions.

If you're an IT professional you should know what xD is in binary without pulling out that pencil. Use MemHex to help you memorize hexidecimal conversions and be on top of your game.

Can you find the easter egg?
